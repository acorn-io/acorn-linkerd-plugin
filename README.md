# acorn-linkerd-plugin

Acorn linkerd plugin provides a way for acorn to integrate with linkerd service mesh. It mainly provides the current functionality to acorn.

1. Automatically add service mesh annotations to acorn workspaces. This ensures every acorn app namespace is annotated with the right annotation to be able to inject linkerd sidecar.

2. Kill linkerd sidecar container for Jobs when all other containers have completed. This is to address https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/issues/8006.

3. Automatically configure linkerd policies to ensure project level networking isolation between acorn projects.

When installing Acorn in your local cluster, if you want to be able to use this plugin, be sure to include these command line options:

```bash
acorn install --propagate-project-annotation "linkerd.io/inject","config.linkerd.io/default-inbound-policy" --set-pod-security-enforce-profile=false
```

> Note: if you are using the Cilium CNI, you do not need the `--set-pod-security-enforce-profile=false` option.

### Build

```bash
make build
```

### Development

The best way to run the plugin is through acorn. Run 

```bash
acorn run --name acorn-linkerd-plugin -i .
```

### Production

```bash
acorn run ghcr.io/acorn-io/acorn-linkerd-plugin:main
```
